            <h2>Types of Health Care Spending</h2>
            <p class="question">What types of health care spending are included in the dataset?</p>
            <p>The dataset includes various types of health care spending such as hospital care, outpatient care,
                long-term care, pharmaceuticals, and preventive care services. It categorizes the expenditures into
                government schemes, compulsory health insurance, voluntary health insurance, and other private
                expenditures.</p>

            <h2>Health Care Spending Variations</h2>
            <p class="question">How does health care spending vary across OECD countries?</p>
            <p>Health care spending varies significantly across OECD countries. Some countries prioritize hospital care,
                while others invest more in outpatient services or long-term care. These differences often reflect the
                country's health care policies, economic conditions, and demographic needs. For instance, countries with
                an aging population may spend more on long-term care services.</p>

            <h2>Trends in Health Care Spending</h2>
            <p class="question">What trends can be observed in health care spending over recent years?</p>
            <p>Over recent years, health care spending has generally increased across OECD countries. This trend can be
                attributed to factors such as aging populations, advancements in medical technology, and increased
                demand for health services. Additionally, economic conditions and health crises, like the COVID-19
                pandemic, have significantly impacted health care expenditures, leading to increased spending in some
                areas.</p>
